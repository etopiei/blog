# blog

The software behind my blog.
Running PHP and MYSQL in the backend.
Super simple and lightweight.

## Install Instrcutions

These are coming soon.

First install Apache and MYSQL then
Something like this:

	$ cd /var/www/html/
	$ git clone git@github.com:etopiei/blog.git . 

Before you begin setup you must create a database with a username and password.
Now Run setup script:

	$ blog.sh

Answer the questions of the install script and it will set up the blog.
Now just write posts in Vanilla HTML at: host.com/newPost.php
The blog will be updated accordingly.

## Any extra questions
