		{"title":"Apple Music Review (One Week In)", "contents":"Just this week I have signed up for apple music. A few things drove this decision, my beginning university being the main motivator (I felt I could use some study jams), as well as the desire to pay for music, and to discover a broad array of new artists. I've been especially impressed thus far with Telstra, as with my pre-paid plan they offer free Apple Music Data, which really makes or breaks a music streaming service in my opinion. Listening to music on wifi can be achieved fairly easily through youtube and other streaming sites, yet being able to listen to literally any song I want while on the go has been a real revelation. Just the other day I was driving home and just hit the play button and off I went, listening to a bunch of new and interesting music all the way home, with essentially no cost.<br> One gripe I have with apple music is that its discovery ability is not nearly as good as Spotify. Finding new albums and releases was simple yet finding music of a certain vibe or mood was quite difficult. The genres are severely lacking containing only very broad categories and no user playlists are available, only the apple curated playlists, which while good, were not as numerous as one may hope.<br> I have discovered a tool though (called STAMP) which can transfer playlists from Spotify to Apple Music so I will perhaps transfer a few of my favourite playlists across and enjoy them on Apple Music that way. But this loophole seems unnecessary and slightly annoying, and I feel as though Apple is a bit behind the 8-ball in terms of allowing user playlists sharing. However this is one small flaw in an otherwise wonderful system.<br> The android app works beautifully, and looks smooth and silky. It has intuitive controls and is a piece of cake for iTunes users, I am a huge fan of album art, so having that all load by default has been a pure joy. All in all I am very happy with the experience and am really enjoying the app, and just listening to more music in general.<br><br>- etopiei<br>(28/1/17)"}
, {"title":"Facebook's Greatest Trick", "contents":"The last 5-10 years facebook has dominated social media, it has taken over our lives and become part of the very fabric of the society in which we live. <br> While many things have changed, from the timeline instead of the wall, to the messenger app, or the surge in advertisements. Yet one thing has remained the same over the years, and that thing is people's belief and their assertions as to their reasons for using facebook. <br> Ask anyone why they have facebook or talk to any new convert, and you will always hear that it is a good way to stay in touch with friends. They talk about reconnecting with old friends and feeling more clued in and connected in their community. <br> The truth is however this belief is a lie, we have conned ourselves into believing, or perhaps been manipulated into believing. The reality is facebook isn't a social media anymore it's a business. Now, this may seem inevitable and even fair when you consider the consequences of connecting billions of people together. Pages are the main source of content on facebook and increasingly it is being used for creators and businesses to advertise and share their content, it is purely centered on content designed and targeted to keep you using facebook. It would be foolish to believe these actions are in order to keep you connected, as facebook, and indeed its users may claim. Facebook now runs almost entirely off messenger and posts from pages and corporations. No longer do you learn much at all about your friends lives from going on facebook. <br> The reason for this is tricky to pin down, I think in part at least it is due to the increased number of parents on facebook, which creates an environment where young people feel less empowered to create their own image and share content. As well as this facebook has become a more critical element in professional circles, in that before receiving a job, you would be foolish to be under the impression that your facebook will not be checked. All in all the current environment is not conducive to the kind of sharing that made it great to begin with, and as such, it has become over-run with ads and media, making it no more than a platform for viral news and content. <br> Yet here is the trick, we still go on facebook, hours a day scrolling through mindlessly. It provides none of the things we signed up for yet wherever you go you see people scrolling through, in a desperate attempt to find what? Facebook has successfully engineered an app that grabs out attention and causes an addiction in the endless scrolling and searching. While messenger is a well built messaging app, there are countless others that serve the same purpose, yet we use facebook because why? Because everyone is on it, it is self-perpetuating and seems difficult to stop. I am not trying to encourage people to delete the facebook app in this article, nor am I advocating that people delete their accounts. I am merely asking that we all become more aware of how we spend our time, how facebook really effects our relationships and how we really stay in touch with one another. Next time you are scrolling through your news feed, ask yourself; Am I enjoying this? Is this helping me stay in touch with friends? What am I getting out of this? You might be surprised by the answers. Also we need to stop lying to each other and ourselves. We don't use facebook to stay in touch anymore, we use it to pass the time, facebook has us hooked scrolling through in search of nothing. <br><br> -etopiei <br> (1/2/17)"}, {"title":"Failure is Not the Cornerstone of Success", "contents":"It's often said that failure is the key to success, that trying over and over again is the solution to eventually achieve our goals. The failure is the cornerstone, upon which great achievements are created, this analogy and this way of thinking is quite dangerous however, as it leads to futile effort and a misplacement of energy. <br> I would certainly agree that failure is important in shaping and moulding us, as individuals and as teams. Yet our ability to succeed is not measured by our failures but by our ability to stop failing. Let me explain a little more what I mean by this. <br> Disclaimer: I will speak from the perspective of learning to code for this article, but this concept applies more generally I believe and is worth exploring. <br><br> Let's say you have just begun to learn to code, you start with a simple hello world, and begin progressing through various data structures and operations. Along the way you make numerous mistakes. You miss semi-colons, you forget to close brackets, you make a small spelling mistake, from each of these experiences you learn something. Conventional wisdom would tell you that because you have failed and learned from your mistakes, you are headed for success and are on a fast-track to becoming an expert. Yet this is only the first step, you must take. There are several levels of responding to failure, the first and easiest is to give up and conclude that something is too hard. The next level is to go ok, I failed but I will try again, and this is greatly encouraged as a pathway to greater things. The level after that is to ask why I failed, to really think and understand the problem and learn from it. At this point most would say it has been a wonderful experience to fail and that you will be better off for this experience. While mostly true, I think one more critical step of evaluation is being missed, after that failure, when continuing on having learned from it, do you keep failing at the same rate or are you improving.<br> I think back to my first ever iPhone app I wrote, it took me days to create some fairly basic functionality and each bug took me hours to solve. Now creating this blog, a much more complicated system, I made few mistakes and could quickly resolve issues I faced. <br> Even with new and challenging materials, your rate of failure should be decreasing as you become more skilful. This is a sign of true aptitude for a particular task or endeavour, now I'm not saying that anyone will become perfect after a few weeks, or ever but too often I think we emphasise the importance of failure, the importance of sticking to something and seeing it through to the bitter end, but for what purpose? <br><br> I once watched a video about a man who decided to quit his job, play golf for a year and aimed to rack up his 10000 hours. This was supposed to be an inspiring video, but I was quite frankly shocked by it. It seemed like an enormous waste, why would you not find something that you have some aptitude for and something you enjoy, truth is you can get good at anything given enough time, but why bother if it isn't something that you feel happy doing, or something that you have some natural ability with. I wonder if our time would be better spent trying to find that thing that our failures disappear with, that we have a gift for, rather than blindly charging on, in an attempt to learn some new skill. Chasing this is what will bring out the best in us, and is something that is not sought with the desperation it deserves. <br><br> -etopiei <br>  (2/2/17)"}]
